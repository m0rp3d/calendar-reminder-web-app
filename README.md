# calendar-reminder-web-app
A web app designed to look like a calendar where the user can login and register to post, update, and delete reminders on the calendar.

The app uses angular framework for the frontend and spring boot framework for the backend. Features include: spring rest jpa for crud methods, angular validation for form input, angular http request methods for database information, sign in and register capabilities, and angular route guards to protect url access.

Here is a demo of the app in action:
